Awhile back I wrote this Yara rule to detect PuzzleMaker malware. Note: This rule needs to be tested again since I don't have access to VTI
rule PuzzleMaker {
   meta:
              description = "Detects PuzzleMaker 0 day Exploit"
              author = "Nicko"
              reference = "https://securelist.com/puzzlemaker-chrome-zero-day-exploit-chain/102771/"
              date = "2021-06-08"
   strings:
      $s1 = "WmiPrvMon.exe" wide
      $s2 = "wmimon.dll" wide
   condition:
     all of them
}
